# Cell growth and division model
At the moment this repository only holds a small R script that
plots the analytic steady state solution for the cell size distribution 
derived in a forthcoming paper by Jose Cuesta, Gustav Delius and Richard Law.
The script will not be useful until the paper is out and you, at
which time we will extend this README.
